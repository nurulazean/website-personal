<h1>My Personal Biography</h1>
<p>Hi and very good afternoon!</p>
<p>First and foremost my name is Nurul Azean Binti Zulkifli. A student at UiTM Machang, Kelantan in Diploma of Information Management. My family members call me "adik" because I'm the youngest, and most of my friends call me "Yan". I'm turning  20 years old this year on the 22nd of July. I also want to share a little bit about my family, as known I'm the youngest among my two sisters. My mother's name is Hajimah and she is a housewife. My father has been passed away since 2014, because of the accident.</p>
<p>Next is I would like to share a few features about myself, which is I'm good at using a social media. As known there over million people using a social media platform to discover new ideas and trends, to connect with the loved ones, shoppings and also to upload some good moments with family members and friends. Back to the topic, I also have my own social media accounts such as whatapps, instagram, twitter, fabebook and many more. Most of my free time I spent in scrolling a social media to get a new updates about the current situation of Malaysia with the pendamic COVID-19 issues, and I also took a chance to shopping some stuffs and upload some memorable pictures and videos to be kept. I'm not doubting myself because I know that I'm too good at using a social media.</p>
<p>The second feature is I love working in a group because I can make some new friends. It's sounds sweet, but how many of us have met in a group to settled the task that has been give. When working in a group, group mates tend to stick for each others, and cover myself during my absence and helping out. We can support each others if there's a problem and give courages. Other than that, I can combined an idea or a skill to make an awesome work beacuse each of the group mates have differents ideas and strengths. My group mates might be more strategic and to make a great team is to have a great communication which is, the ability to present the ideas clearly and honesly and also respecting others member views.</p>
